🤖 Welcome to GRAID!
   Generating Reasoning questions from Analysis of Images via Discriminative artificial intelligence

GRAID provides two main capabilities:

🗄️ Dataset Generation (generate-dataset):
• Multiple datasets: BDD100K, NuImages, Waymo + Custom datasets
• Multi-backend support: Detectron2, MMDetection, Ultralytics
• Ensemble models with Weighted Box Fusion (WBF)
• Ground truth data or custom model predictions
• Unlabeled image support (models generate detections)
• Standard formats with COCO-style annotations
• Interactive configuration and batch processing

🧠 VLM Evaluation (eval-vlms):
• Evaluate Vision Language Models: GPT, Gemini, Llama
• Multiple evaluation metrics: LLMJudge, ExactMatch, Contains
• Various prompting strategies: ZeroShot, CoT, SetOfMark, Constrained Decoding
